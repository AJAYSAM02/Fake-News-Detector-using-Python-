- importing necessary libraries
- loading the dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- initializing  TfidfVectorizer. TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- fit and transform the vectorizer on the train set, and transform the vectorizer on the test set
- Now initializing PassiveAggressiveClassifier.Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss. Weâ€™ll fit this on tfidf_train and y_train
- we use test dataset for prediction from the TfidfVectorizer and calculate the accuracy with accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics
